# Simple Calculator (Python)

A simple Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  

This project uses **functions**, a **loop**, and a **menu system** to let the user choose the operation they want.

## Features
- Add two numbers  
- Subtract two numbers  
- Multiply two numbers  
- Divide two numbers (checks for division by zero)  
- Loop to perform multiple calculations until the user exits  
- User-friendly menu for easy selection

## How It Works

1. **Functions**: Each operation has its own function:  
   - `add(a, b)` → returns sum  
   - `subtract(a, b)` → returns difference  
   - `multiply(a, b)` → returns product  
   - `divide(a, b)` → returns division result (handles divide by zero)  

2. **Menu System**: The program displays a menu and asks the user to choose an operation.  

3. **Loop**: The program uses a loop to allow the user to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit.
